# Anomaly Detection in Time Series
This project explores different methods for anomaly detection in time series data, specifically focusing on CPU utilization data from an AWS EC2 instance. The following techniques are implemented and compared:

- Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)
- Isolation Forest
- Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

## Use Case

We use real-life data on CPU utilization of an AWS EC2 instance, recorded every 5 minutes starting from February 14th at 14:30 PM. The dataset contains 4032 data points and is sourced from the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) repository, available under the AGPL-3.0 License.
